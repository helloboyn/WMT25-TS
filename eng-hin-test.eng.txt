the appellants were further sent for trial .
thereafter , they left her by train .
what had happened then is a mystery .
his statement is not of any use .

therefore , no interference is called for .

thus , no shop was found vacant .
the reply was considered by the authority .
the State is supposed to act unarbitrarily .

the departmental appeal was dismissed on 04.04.2011 .

Krishna Yadav was present there with two others .
the hands and feet of PW-8 were tied .
she also identified the two in the court .
he had gone home to save his life .
where the cause of the proceedings has arisen .
these two petitions do not help the appellants .
the facts of this case are quite different .
5- PW-2 is the uncle of Mujibur Rahman .
the State delayed the matter without any reason .
that right cannot be deprived of the petitioner .
this term was concluded in the year 2011 .
the reason for the payment , as above .
but do we retain so high a standard ?
this is not available in the present case .
deceased Manoj Chaudhary was running to save him .
both the chambers of the heart were empty .
after investigation , he submitted the charge sheet .
he noticed that Manoj Kumar Choudhary was holding .
Dinesh Chowdhary and Manoj Chaudhary had fallen down .
the injury report was received by the police .
otherwise , it would not be a compromise .
I shall in his evidence point out improbabilities .
both PWs 3 and 4 support the prosecution .
hence , the suit itself was not maintainable .
the impugned order is allowed the cancelled application .
he had travelled by train the whole night .
she had accompanied them by her own will .
he was thereafter taken to the police station .
the police party , however , stopped him .
they have been declared hostile by the prosecution .
PW-12 is the Investigating Officer of the case .
she died during the pendency of this appeal .
what has to be done when that happens ?
no transfer of any property can be made .
this second appeal is , thus , allowed .

this will be an appeal to the Kaiser .
21- Accordingly , the writ application is allowed .
this point is accordingly decided against the plaintiff-appellant .

she had worked there for about three years .

during this time , his uncle had come .
she had told her uncle about the incident .
26- The defence has also examined two witnesses .
such a marriage is not permissible in law .
several other facts have also been pointed out .
it is recommended or recommended in most cases .
18- Accordingly , this writ petition is dismissed .
local Management Grade on 1 . 8 . 1986
( e ) 25 years after pensionable service .

list of transactional engineers is Annexure - 2 .
in fact , no departmental proceedings were pending .
but the trial for promotion cannot be excluded .
11- Accordingly , the writ petition is allowed .
8- The defendants have also produced documentary evidence .
the petitioner was only allotted room No. 33 .
this is intended to deal with a contingency .
this has been illegally sealed by the respondents-authorities .
none of those witnesses has ever been declared hostile .
all the three assailants had fled towards the north .
they had pleaded Sunita , hence the trial proceeded .
for this , the prosecution has examined four eye-witnesses .
the informant narrated the incident which was around 8 p.m.
this evidence has come in para 3 of PW1 .
hence his conviction under Section 302 IPC is upheld .
all the wounds were besieged by the black region .
as noticed above , Will is marked as Exhibit-1 .
the testator had signed each page of the will .
an opportunity will be given to make a representation .
the representation was made on 29th July , 2013 .
the petitioner prays that the said representation be considered .
accordingly , the suit of the plaintiff was decreed .
the investigation can also be ordered by the CBI .
this argument is taken note of only to reject .
it is just being made to cover their failure .
persons in three positions have been employed on contract .
the said miscellaneous case was also dismissed on 16.03.2012 .
hence , he has to be dealt with accordingly .
in such circumstances , the petitioner should be prosecuted .
he tested and found the weapons and ammunitions effective .
the said notice was duly answered by the petitioner .
the interlocutory application No.700 of 2013 is disposed of .
obviously , the petitioner has failed in that test .
there is no dispute on this finding of fact .
he was armed with Lathi , Bhala and Pharsa .
Nago Singh had brought his two sons on horse .
2- The subject matter is in a short compass .
a departmental proceeding was also initiated against the delinquent .
the delinquent cannot have any further cause of action .
he is also a attestation witness of the fardbeyan .
20- In the result , this appeal is allowed .
these facts are not disputed in the counter affidavit .
no provision of appeal has been arranged against it .
it does not exclude judicial review under Article 226 .
the case was committed to the Court of Session .
that person disclosed his name to Prem Prakash Yadav .
he had provided the telephone number to the police .
the man who accompanied him went away leaving him .
as has been calculated by the learned trial court .
he has no idea where VIP bag was seized .
the seizure list has already been marked as Exhibit-3 .
they have fully supported the case of the prosecution .
21- In the result , these appeals are dismissed .
the police had taken both the persons into custody .
a telephone number was given of Bettiah Police Station .
at that time , Bhola had also accompanied her .
on 27.11.2011 , he left the train for Bettiah .
but Bhola had remained with her for a day .
he has proved the formal FIR ( Exh.7 ) .
confessional statement of Krishna Yadav was recorded on 07.12.2011 .
thereafter , they took them to hospital for treatment .
12- PW-3 Arvind Kumar is the brother of the informant-
4- PW-4 Md . Hasal is brother's gotra .
in this context , two facts may be noted .
12- In the result , this appeal is allowed .
7- They had been working in the same manner .
the facts of the present case are totally different .
thus , the matter was reached the Supreme Court .
the informator was taken to Sadar Hospital for treatment .
Gopal Chaudhary's business is in the serai .
Dinesh Chaudhury's house is from the east .
he has supported the case of prosecution like PW-1 .
the cervical cavity contained blood clots and brain material .
formal FIR by way of Exh.5 has been proved .
he did not examine how they got their injuries .
17 . PW-3 is the son of Dinesh Choudhary .
Ram Kumar Choudhary had come there armed with pistol .
he admitted that there is Government Hospital in Begusai .
he had not gone to Government Hospital at Bedusai .
such injuries are not fatal and are not visible .
13- I have heard learned counsels for the parties .
she also claims that Sanjay used to take tuition .
the aforesaid suggestion has been denied by the witnesses .
his name was also given by the former landlord .
the other witnesses are the eye-witnesses of the incident .
Hon'ble Rakesh Kumar , J. Madhulay and others .
respectively marked as exhibit Exts.2 , 3 and 4 .
they had raped her for about 10 days continuously .
she states that police did not record her statement .
she was moving from place to place without resistance .
I also agree with the test in that case .
8- In the result , this appeal is allowed .
after declaring them hostile , the prosecution examined them .
the sample was taken from one or two packets .
no inventory was prepared to justify the seized guarantee .
the material exhibits were never produced in the court .
hence , the accused is entitled to be acquitted .
it is mentioned that she has constructed a temple .
this , in my opinion , cannot be said .
the plaintiff is not a member of the family .
in my opinion , there is no such protest .
he had no jurisdiction at all in the matter .
both the persons had died in the same accident .
one who declares the age of youth or child .
whenever she offered marriage to him , she denied .
19- PW-2 is Dr. ( Smt ) Annapurna Singh .
his age was assessed between 19 - 20 years .
20- PW-3 Raj Kumar Paswan is an hearsay witness .
Harendra Sah ( PW-3 ) was the witness of fardbeyan .
the wound was on the right side of the stomach .
it was within 20 hours of its passing after death .
however , both the sentences are directed to run concurrently .
6- We are unable to agree with Mr. Rajendra Prasad .
6- The appellants and Naval Kishore Sharma were also tried .
the petitioner being the youngest son performed her last rites .
the said Will was the last will of the testator .
the will executed by the testator at Ex . 1 .
AWI Ram Bahadur Singh is one of the attesting witnesses .
the Will was executed by the testator in his favour .
the will and its contents are proved by the witnesses .
however , none has appeared on behalf of respondent no.5 .
5- The petition is disposed of in the above terms .
this fact has not been disputed by defendant-respondent No. 1 .
the judgment and decree of the trial court are recalled .
it seems that my boy has died of the injury .
today the dicker of the crashed car is switched off .
9- For the aforesaid reason , we allow this appeal .
as mentioned above , the petitioner was in this panel .
the said agreement is Appendix 5 of the present application .
thus , they have supported the case of the prosecution .
the incident is of 1997 and aged about 10 years .
he had , therefore , invested huge amounts of money .
as a result , the running decisions are set aside .
this could not have been ruled out by the appellants .
the said order is meaningless in the eyes of law .
he submits that many persons were appointed on compassionate ground .
the cross examination was not successful in refuting its veracity .
15- The impugned judgment , therefore , is set aside .
PW10 Sachchidananda Choudhury is the Investigating Officer of the case .
8- PW-8 Ravinder Singh is the informator of the case .
thereafter Ravinder landed from the bus and gave five rupees .
the said amendment application was rejected by the appellate court .
that evidence has been considered by both the courts below .
Ram Naresh Singh picked up some things from a box .
accused persons also fired gun in the course of escape .
13- For the aforesaid reason , the appeal is allowed .
the respondent is directed to co-operate in the departmental proceedings .
5- The Tribunal has been created by a statutory order .
therefore , no offence is made out under this section .
the defence of the accused persons is of false implication .
she also stated that one day telephone had been received .
after taking her child , she had returned to Kahalgaon .
he had given a written notice in the police station .
14 . PW-8 is the Investigating Officer of this case .
PW-6 is the paternal grand-father and informant- of the victim .
the literal meaning of the landless should be given effect .
the injury caused by fire arms was ante-mortem in nature .
the defence of the accused is that they are innocent .
Krishna Yadav alias Maama was also with the police party .
thereafter , Krishna had moved forward and others followed him .
he is a workman only for the last 4 years .
she also stated that police party was armed with firearms .
thereafter PWs 5 , 6 and 7 had been banished .
she also identified her signature ( Ext.3 / 2 ) .
instead of her living , she had changed every time .
he has identified his signature ( Exh.4 ) on 9.12.2011 .
he had climbed into the train and had gone home .
she identified her signatures at Ex . 4 / 5 .
he does not know the name of the old man .
source of information has been received from PW-7 Rajendra Singh .
there is no likelihood of any confusion in the FIR .
50- Resultantly , the reference of death is set aside .
Bhola Thakur was beaten by Kapil Thakur with a stick .
this witness has answered that Pulani was on his ground .
there was no default on the part of the petitioner .
which is vested to assist the change in a right .
thus seen , the petitioner had right to be absorbed .
the payment was exonerated in compliance of the judicial direction .
it has prepared one of the grounds of its removal .
these proceedings were not initiated before the elections of 2006 .
in view of this , appendix 26 is also rescinded .
11- PW-2 is the informant and father of the deceased .
12- PW-3 is the informant and victim of the incident .
they informed the police about the arrival of the injured .
he collected blood stained earth from the place of incident .
in the meanwhile , Ram Kumar Choudhary fired the shot .
she saw that Manoj Kumar Choudhary had received gunshot injury .
leave behind his mentioned heirs lies behind him in heaven .
14- Order XXIII Rule 3 deals with compromise of suit .
he is in custody for 3 months and 29 days .
4- Both the parties have produced oral and documentary evidence .
the appellant Gopal Singh had placed a pistol on him .
she also admits that childhood is four kilometres from Samasa .
thereafter , she used to live with one Mukesh Singh .
there , too , he did not make any disclosure .
the appellant Umesh Ram did not meet inside the house .
Jayakal Devi was arrested and brought to the police station .
however , nothing material could come out from their cross-examination .
he states that a woman was caught outside the house .
he also admits he had not gone inside the house .
he also admits that the seized ganja was not sealed .
all these witnesses were present when the bomb was thrown .
the plaintiff and his father were staying with Bageshwar Kunar .
the mutawalli is also not a member of the family .
this is apparent from Annexure-3 , which is dated 15.09.1989 .
it is this main order which is under challenge effectively .
he challenged this order on two grounds , inter alia .
it cannot be presumed or cannot be included in it .
the Committee of Management , therefore , came into the minority .
Ex . 1 / A Dedger signed by Lutto Manjhi .
death took place in shock and haemorrhage from Injury No. 1 .
Parash Sah is not a stranger as he is a neighbour .
some of the witnesses have stated that Parash Sah caught Maheshwari .

he claims to be in this business since 1986 - 87 .
no property was filed by anyone including relatives near the testator .
an amendment petition was filed seeking amendment of the main application .
counter affidavit has also been filed on behalf of the respondents .
however , they had taken a lot of money from home .
none is present on behalf of respondent Nos. 5 and 6 .
the same is true for Appellate Authority and Board of Revenue .
( II ) there is no evidence of payment of rent ;
no documentary evidence was produced in support of the said claim .
Hon'ble NALAYA PRASAD SINGH , J. Oudh Kishore Thakur , J.
one additional post can help the petitioner only , if any .
the parties , however , have to bear their own costs .
4- The Informant has extended the revisional jurisdiction of this Court .
the petitioner has not examined any defence witness in his defence .
therefore , the appropriate explanation is available on the record itself .
it is also clear that it contains the signatures of ACJM .
copy of the said order is marked to the writ petitioner .
this witness had proved the admission order as Ex . 1 .
the aforesaid circumstance , therefore , raises suspicion about the prosecution .
therefore , the aforesaid contradiction raises a suspicion about the prosecution .
evidence which creates confidence to contradict an injured witness is necessary .
which indicates the performance of the duties of Simati Sinha regularly .
the government considers your action to be merely pretentious and positive .
14- Thus , two things become clear from his aforesaid explanation .
Ex.2 Krishan Dev Mandal has been declared hostile by the prosecution .
at that time , Kumar was going to Kurseong by Katihar .
7- PW-1 , Krishna Mahto is the informant-in-charge of the case .
as a matter of fact , the bank failed to respond .
if respondent No.6 was not appointed , he raised a dispute .
on his confirmation , Lal Kunda and thereafter came to Haldwani .
he had not come to Haldani to take any of them .
thereafter both of them had gone from the rickshaw to Ramnagar .
she had an opportunity to talk to her parents at Haldani .
these appeals have no merit and are dismissed for this reason .
according to the doctor , the girl was habitual to cohabitation .
Vishwanath Agarwal Versus Sarla Nath Agarwal ( 2012 ) 7 SCC 288
3 . lacerated wound present on right side of neck with injury

after 3 - 4 kilometres , there was a sugarcane field .
the police officer had asked Krishna where he had kept Sardar .
he also stated that Krishan Yadav disclosed his name on telephone .
after crossing the river , Krishna gave the boatman the money .
in the night , she heard the voices of some persons .
relying on his statement , he had come to Krishna Yadav .
for this reason , the prosecution case should not be believed .
thus , we do not find any merit in their appeals .
there was a abrasion on the back of the right thumb .
14- PW5 Arun Kumar Thakur is the informator of this case .
she has stated that she sustained injuries on her left hand .
he came to this Court long before the Rules of 2003 .
they cannot be held unfit now and cannot be taken out .
because at that time the Selection Commission was not in existence .
the writ was decided in her favour by order dated 16.03.2009 .
Indian Penal Code , 1860 - Section 304 , Part II .
the left parital and occipital bones of the skull were broken .
it is not true that Dinesh Choudhury was building a house .
the body of Manoj Kumar Choudhary was taken to the hospital .
other grounds too , too , may shock the inner mind .
the evidence of these witnesses is consistent , reliable and trustworthy .
PW-5 Investigating Officer has also found blood stains on the spot .
the said fine is to be paid to the victim girl .
he also alleges that his brother Mrityunjaya Kumar was also present .
thus the involvement of Kishori Mohan and Mritunjaya Kumar becomes suspicious .
he claims that he had not intervened in the ongoing tussle .
Mandhata Singh , J. Heard learned counsels for the parties .
advocate . - Mr . VISKN , Form V or App ;
after her marriage , she was residing in her matrimonial home .

she neither raised alarm nor resisted or in any manner whatsoever .
some co - villagers were provided with vehicles to draw loads .
the investigation officer was not a member of the raid party .
only the presence of this accused-appellant is stated by these witnesses .
hence , for the aforesaid relief , the suit was filed .
according to Hindu law , an idol is a judicial person .
no inherent power exists in any authority as declared by them .
it is the order of the managing committee of the Madarsa .
it is not a case of total non-consideration of the evidence .
the Investigating Officer of the case has been examined as PW-6 .
13- Now , I take over the merits of the case .
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence .
he has proved the written report , which is at Ex .
she states that the Lok Sabha elections were held on 16.6.1996 .
in her examination of the chief she fancies to be unmarried .
23- PW-6 Poonam Kumari is the Investigating Officer of the case .
his examination has no explanation on the part of the prosecution .

Ex . 3 . endorsement and forwarding of endorsement by the officer-in-charge .
injury no.1 died and injury No. 2 was the result of stitches .
Devaki Sah stabbed the matter in the right side of Maheshwari Sah .

Rule 3 of the Rules provides the qualifications for a deed writer .
5- Mr. Rajendra Prasad , learned counsel has appeared for the appellants .
thereafter , no examination has been conducted for the last 12 years .
neither any objection nor any representation had been filed on his behalf .

they claim to identify the signature of their father on the will .
he also identified the Will ( marked as Ex . 1 ) .
the execution of the Will was the voluntary act of the testator .
advocate . - Mr . Jetcea Prasied , Bud Notifications , Mr .
the defendant had filed a title appeal before the lower appellate court .
when they came here they found that they had not received money .
the incident has happened due to the negligence driving of the vehicle .
4- The claim was contested by the appellant who is a purchaser .
the non-recording of his findings by the lower authority vitiate the order .
the defendant had also denied to pay any rent to the plaintiff .
in the absence of which the authority could not consider his case .
this Court is not interested in what had happened in the meanwhile .
heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the respondent .
their evidence has been dealt with by the trial court very seriously .
there is no such disclosure that it was ever signed by PW-2 .
the aforesaid incident was caused in the background of the land dispute .
4- The suit property is mentioned in Schedule 1 of the plaint .
thus , Dr. Sinha appears to be guilty of the said absence .
I also sent the application for special leave on 14.05.03 by post .
operational Practitioners Sub Secretary , Health Department , Bihar , Patna .
27- With the aforementioned observations and reference , this application is decanted .
she also sustained injuries on her right hand and neck by others .
this witness has proved his written report by way of Exhibit 2 .
now , therefore , this issue was not before the trial court .

at the time of escape , they were locked in a room .
in the absence of Panchas , he handed over both the sons .
after two days , Ram Kumar Singh had returned both the children .

what the petitioner wanted was to revoke the suspension and nothing more .
8- PW-2 Gauri Mehto is the uncle and informant-in-law of the deceased .
10- PW-4 Champa Devi is the informator and mother of the deceased .
in the light of his evidence , he has been declared hostile .
this fact is secondary for the reason that it had more marks .

6- With the aforesaid change of sentence , the appeal stands dismissed .
one day the kidnappers had advised him to talk to the sea .
two persons had asked him whether he had brought the entire amount .

( ii ) Whether the lower Court has misconstrued and misinterpreted Ex.-II .
it provides that precedence should be given while entering into a settlement :
( E ) to refugees from East Pakistan and Verma after 1.1.1964 .
if this submission is accepted , it will create confusion and chaos .
the lower appellate court had recorded that the plaintiff is not landless .

the appellants are on bail and are accordingly discharged of their liability .

I read out my statement and made the signature as correct . 
the defence was to be false implication on account of Panchayat elections .
PW-6 admits that a distant Rahman had filed a case against him .
thus , the court remains only the sole evidence of PW-6 informant .
she has not given any description about the injuries sustained by her .
he had thus worked before the 2003 Rules for almost a decade .
it had compelled the petitioner to file many suits and not one .
the authority cannot refuse to act on its own will or will .
many persons had come there after being panic and saw the incident .
there are three sons of Umu Choudhary , Kanhaiya and Kundan Choudhary .
the land dispute is going on between Dinesh Choudhary and Umesh Choudhary .

he also states that these injuries cannot be manufactured by friendly hands .
he cannot say whether the police referred them to the Government Hospital .
Dinesh Chaudhary and Shikant Choudhary have not been explained the injuries suffered .
the case prepared by Rashid is that she went to the college .
therefore , after the gift , the name of the jamabandi mother .
therefore , no finding could be recorded in favour of the plaintiff .
he also admits that there is a land dispute between the parties .
11- PW-7 Md . Yusuf is an eye witness of the incident .
this , according to the doctor , is a life threatening condition .
13- PW10 Ram Bal Singh is the Investigating Officer in this case .

the petitioner in this panel was in sixth number being a general category .
the Court orders where his case may be considered in accordance with law .
12- The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid test and reference .
during the course of the statement , he had merely denied the incident .
with regard to the incident , paras 8 and 9 are also present .
during cross-examination the defence may not be able to rebut his evidence . 
more than that , as it is today , he is on bail .
the licence was granted for a period up to 31st December , 2004 .
cognizance of the offence was taken and the appellant was put on trial .

in such a situation leave can be granted as casual leave on 14.05.2003 .
Dr. Simati Sinha can be relieved of the charge mentioned in the Annexure .
Vice Secretary of the Government . . . 25 . 5 . 04 .
whereas the appellant Mohd . Alam had been able to escape from there .
his bag had already been snatched and then he was assaulted by Farasa .
this witness has also stated that he again regained consciousness in the hospital .
the plaintiffs were always ready and willing to pay the balance consideration amount .
they have given evidence of their willingness in support of their respective claims .
while Chano Singh gave lathi blow on him as well as Kunti Devi .
Ram Shankar Singh and Rajendra Singh were the witnesses to prove the FIR .
the admission scrutiny of the evidence of the witnesses during trial is inevitable .
hence , the concurrent findings of the courts in question are set aside .
6- In my view , this submission has been noticed only for rejection .
6- The Tribunal is a quasi judicial body constituted to decide a case .
even in his cross-examination , he has supported the case of the prosecution .
PW-7 is the doctor who has found the girl for about 14-15 years .
8- The appeal is accordingly dismissed with the aforesaid modification in the sentence .
on 24.07.2012 the matter was again heard and was taken up for hearing .
on these findings , the trial Court dismissed the suit of the plaintiff .
the recovered from the wound is being forwarded under a FB seal cover .

he identified the accused Bhola Mahto , who was present in the Court .
he only knew the name of Krishna , his parents were not named .
PW-8 and Krishan had boarded the boat and the remaining two had returned .
PW-8 and Krishna had walked for about 45 minutes and reached a hut .
earlier , he had installed a Raeling machine in the State of Jharkhand .
9- 10 persons were put before him and the accused persons had identified .
at the instance of Krishna Yadav , he went to the station chowk .
he has also stated that he had taken him to a snail vehicle .
three more persons came there identified as accused Ravi , Liberation and Dashrath .
an old man of the village had come to him and opened it .
two persons came there and their names were Mukti Narayan Choudhury and Dasaratha .
PW-6 is Madan Kumar Pandey who has examined two injured in this case .
PW-6 contradicts each other with regard to injury on the person of the informant-
the remainder was to seek a concurrence only of Bihar Public Service Commission .
the argument on behalf of the State , thus , cannot be accepted .
25- The writ petitions are thus allowed with the aforesaid observations and directions .
on 10.05.2005 , one of Poonam Kumari was appointed as an education friend .
having reached the present status , they could be made non - entitled .
no one can be allowed to carry a whip on a dead horse .
merely because the power vested in the State Election Commission is not disputed .
he identified the two accused Pankaj Chaudhary and Shashi Choudhary in the Court .
his father's brothers live separately and are also divided into smats .
the death took place 12 hours at the time of post mortem examination .
they have proved the post mortem report , which is marked as Exhibit-2 .
in his opinion injuries No.1 , 2 and 3 are simple in nature .
both the injury reports are marked as Exhibits 3 and 3 / 1 .
he got information about the incident which was mentioned in the case diary .
situated on behalf of the defence , 3 Shikshanta Chaudhury has been examined .
5- Therefore , there is an inquiry on two aspects of this case .
the radiologist's report would be very relevant to indicate his age .
after the settlement , permit was issued and rental receipt was also released .
hence , the property is properly recorded in the name of the defendant .
7- As stated above , none is present on behalf of the respondent .
present case has been filed under section 106 of the Bihar Tenancy Act .
no separate sentence has been passed under Section 323 of Indian Penal Code .
he submits that this document was not exhibited before the learned Claims Tribunal .
4- In the course of investigation , the victim prayed Devi was recovered .
in cross-examination , he states that the victim was married five years ago .
thereafter , Gopal Singh and Mukesh Singh had snatched his jewellery and stick .
she states that her signatures were obtained on four or five blank papers .
the train was stop at these stations for some time and then proceeded .
learned counsel would submit that the new Committee of Management has not been elected .
thus , the order passed on 10.12.2012 has lost its force after six months .
Akhilesh Chandra , J. Both the appeals arise out of the same judgment .
they have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment .
on Ex . 1 / B - fardbeyan , the signatures of Niru Manjhi .
necessary follow - up work will be carried out within a month from today .
Maheshwari Sah fainted on the way and its unconscious state continued till his death .
Devaki Sah and Suresh Sah started abusing Maheshwari Sah , whose answer was given .
the case of the prosecution that Maheshwari Sah was stabbed and properly set up .
the allegation that Maheshwari died due to stabbing by Dev Sah is well established .
hence , two parties have appeared in connection with the role of Paras Sah .
hence , his case stands on a different footing from that of Devaki Sah .
he is ordered to be released forthwith if not required in any other case .
he had stated that he had not found any blank work on the spot .
admittedly , the aforesaid land was PW-5 and the ancestral land of the appellants .
accordingly , the appellants are acquitted of the charges while granting benefit of doubt .
thus the aforesaid propounder is not going to support the plea of the petitioner .
the witness identified the signatures of the testatrix on each page of the Will .
3- Mr. Vikas Kumar , learned counsel has appeared for Bihar Public Service Commission .
Ext . 5 has been produced by the plaintiff in support of his case .

they have relied on the genealogy presented in Appendix 6 of the writ petition .
2- I shall refer to the position of the parties before the trial Court .
3- The State has filed a counter affidavit and the reply is on record .
it is not disputed that the petitioner has been participating in the execution proceedings .
the fact that the parties entered into a compromise is also not in dispute .
16 . consequently , the writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated above .
V.N. Sinha , J. Heard the petitioners and learned counsel for the State .
it is apparent from the record that the Investigating Officer has not been examined .
he also submitted that the complainant sustained seven injuries and he lost two teeth .
the fact of recovery is not supported even by any of the independent witnesses .
consequently , the running decisions do not justify it's over - riding .
he has contested the appeal and supported the order of the learned Single Judge .
the licence which had already expired could not have been renewed in any event .
14- The Registry to send a copy of this order to the respondent forthwith .
he had come out of the office and met the appellant outside the office .
this finding could have been recorded only in an appeal filed by the appellants .
6- For the aforesaid reason , this petition is dismissed at the very threshold .
the name of Punai Yadav is recorded as an occupancy ryot in survey works .
Dukuni Kunwar left behind her daughter Krishna Devi in 1970 and died in 1970 .
the dispute is whether the suit property was a part of the last division .
the plot no.2171 is the name of Punai Yadav and is measuring 17 Disil .
no lady physician official at Baroda headquarters is available with his own medical practitioner .
the certificate regarding treatment and other evidence was made available to the presiding officer .
7- Now , I shall proceed to deal with the evidence of other eye-witnesses .
9- PW4 Mice Singh is resident of Fuleria Chowk , the place of occurrence .
hence , the same matter cannot be cross - examined in this second appeal .
in evidence they had never claimed to be a part of the suit property .
thereafter both the accused persons ran away taking both her sons and the goods .
they did not enquire about the place for appointing their sons with Nagno Singh .
the petitioners are on bail , therefore , they are discharged of their liability .
as regards the said incident , a criminal case was registered against the delinquent .
8- The learned counsel , Mrs. Nilalu Agarwal , has appeared for the appellants .
they have relied upon the supplementary affidavit filed in the present Letters Patent Appeal .
they have taken us through the records and possible defence at the criminal trial .
before his arrival , Amit Kumar had fainted , fallen down and started trembling .
11- PW-5 Shri Ram Mahto is another brother of the deceased and the informant-in-law .
thus , his evidence is of no avail in support of the prosecution case .
in other words , the department wants to be benefited by its own default .
4- The counsel for the State submits that notice be issued to respondent No.6 .
the whole business seems to be negative in the way the tribunals are working .
the concern of the court is with serious infirmity in the decision making process .
the matter has to be remanded to the Tribunal even after it is present .
he has stated that both the children had gone to school from the rickshaw .

her intention was never to cause any harm to the cattle of the complainant .
the same party was taken by other witnesses who were examined during the investigation .
the suit land is situated at a distance of 50 bighas from the school .
according to the learned counsel , Exh.2 was the report of the Pleader Commissioner .
however , the defence has not led any evidence in support of its case .

he also stated that he knew Bhola Mahto and Krishna Yadav before the incident .

accused Ravi had come to him and had snatched bag of PW13 and mobile .
23- PW-1 has stated that accused Upendra Chaudhary and Chandeshwar Sah are his co-villagers .
death penalty can be desirable where the victims are innocent children and helpless women .
his cross - examination reveals that Vataka was about 15 Kathas under polemical orders .

the details of the said property are fully mentioned in Schedule 1 of the application .
affidavit was filed keeping on record the news papers in which the issues were published .
when the Will was executed by the testator , he was physically and mentally ill .
before signing the will , he had read and understood the contents of the Will .
the son of the testator , Ajit Kumar Singh also signed as a attesting witness .
the boundary mentioned therein does not match with the postulate mentioned in the present suit .
the other case of defendant-respondent no.1 is that the property was that of Murad Ali .
no money was found in the car even though he was carrying lot of money .
no proper investigation has been carried out to ascertain the true and the real developments .
it was argued that the plaintiff had filed a separate suit for recovery of rent .
learned counsel thus submitted that the impugned judgment and order does not warrant any interference .
in this manner , the departments of the Government will act as efficient parties . 
the petitioner is also interested in drafting his appointment and obtaining roster NOCs for appointment .
the person appointing him shall be liable to pay the wages and not the State .
in the absence of any notice , the executing court cannot proceed according to them .
however , the FIR was seen by the Chief Judicial Magistrate , Saharsa on 13.11.1986 .

therefore , the submission is that a running judgment is liable to be set aside .
however , on arrival of several persons , her father was taken for medical treatment .
however , keeping it in mind , the Magistrate had taken cognizance in the matter .
hence , during the course of revisional jurisdiction , it should not be interfered with .

at that time , a boy inflicted a farsa blow on the forehead of Ravinder .
the parties also agreed that the deed was to be executed and registered within 1.11.1987 .
so far as this conclusion is concerned , it is a pure finding of fact .
now he cannot change his side and say that the evidence should not be seen .
at the same time , the unknown criminals were preventing them from entering the room .
the evidence of PW2 in Principal examination further makes the version of the witness suspect .
hence , the learned Single Judge had declined to extend time and rejected the application .
the appellants should be permitted to proceed further in the departmental proceedings against the delinquent .
9- Mr. Kishore Kumar Thakur , learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the delinquent .
2- perused the records of Sessions trial received in compliance of our order dated 17.09.2013 .

Cri.App. ( 28J ) No. 120 of 1996 . decided on 5th November , 2012 .
therefore , the order cancelling the settlement is illegal and not binding on the plaintiff .
according to the learned counsel , Ex.-C is the basis of the plaintiff's case .
after due enquiry the land was settled by the SDO in favour of the plaintiff .
on these grounds , learned counsel submitted that the impugned judgment and decree is vitiated .
the concept of settlement is for settlement of land in favour of the landless peasants .
so far as landless is concerned , it has not been defined in the circular .
the left ( PLUL ) cavity contained almost 1 pins of blood and blood clot .
on the basis of the written notice given by him , an FIR was registered .
he had given mobile no through which messages were sent and received on the mobile .
in his cross-examination , he has stated that he has no identification with Krishna Yadav .
on 8.12.2011 , he was first stubbed at the Police Station and met his brother .
Krishna had asked his brother to meet in the field as much time was available .
she also stated that she also identified the accused persons at the Test Identification Parade .
thereafter , the police came to his house and on 11.11.2011 he accompanied the police .
due to confusion in Muharram , the FIR could not be sent in due time .
after a journey of one and a half hour , the forest area had started .
40- It appears that the prosecution witnesses were quite natural and their evidence inspires confidence .
5- The 7 witnesses in this case have been examined on behalf of the prosecution .
11- PW-2 Ramji Thakur has been named in the first information report as a witness .
after investigation , the charge sheet was submitted against the driver of the malleable bus .
he also admits that the respective shares of the parties were measured by the Amin .
the injury report will show that admittedly Alam was examined in this case on 24.06.1991 .
thus , there is a kind of case having been seen by the four petitioners .
the petitioners had become almost redundant in the Corporation and were to be made elsewhere .
again , as it happens in the State , the matter did not proceed further .
it was a state which had to be awakened from deep insomnia time and again .
in other words , it was the duty of the State to act as such .
3- In this case , the counter affidavit and the supplementary counter affidavits have been filed .
5- The defence of the accused persons was that of false implication on account of enmity .
the post mortem report ( Ext.2 ) indicates that the death took place within 20 hours .
the doctor has been cross examined regarding the manner of incident or the time of death .
Suresh Sah and Paras Sah caught hold of Maheshwari Sah and dragged her towards the bridge .
this party has been prepared having regard to filling up the lacuna in the prosecution case .
they can easily identify their family members and close neighbours even in the night without lighting .
the case of both stands different on the basis of the evidence produced by the prosecution .
it is not the claim of the petitioners that they were in this profession since 1981 .
10- We are informed in the Court that the last such test was conducted in 2001 .
behind the alleged incident , land dispute reasons have been stated as disclosed by the informant .
it is an admitted position that PW-5 and the appellants were co-sharers in the aforesaid land .
4- The Will attached to the application has been proved and marked as Ex . 1 .
there was no pressure or coercion on the testator to execute a Will in his favour .
8- On a perusal of Ext.1 , it appears that the Will was prepared on 8.8.2006 .
a sentence provided for different offences may be punishable with death penalty or imprisonment for life .
4 . consequently , the writ application has to fail and the same is accordingly dismissed .
the transferee did not acquire any right , title and interest nor was he in possession .
if it is inadmissible , then there is no document of the title of the plaintiff .
in a municipal survey Khatiyan , the entry cannot be called as conclusive proof of title .
E . to grant relief ( reliefs ) to which the petitioner is found entitled to .
the plaintiff and his brother Ravinder Singh claiming to be the grandson of Ram Charan Singh .
he also claims to pay rent and electrical connection to the State in his own name .
now it is stated that there were not only twelve sanctioned posts but sixteen accepted posts .
paras 2 to 9 of his cross examination seem to be of kinship with each other .
hence , the said order cannot be a ground for cancellation of licence renewed on 06.09.2011 .
no doubt , this is a matter which has to be examined by the State Government .
Cri.App. ( 28J ) no . 246 of 2001 . decided on 8th October , 2013 .
he has submitted that the reply letter submitted by the petitioner has not been properly valued .
prima facie , we do not find the replies furnished by the petitioner to be evaluated .
thus , the factum of partition effected in the past has been admitted by subsequent parties .
my children and children are unable to stay with me for the purpose of getting education .
it went to Monghyr on 13 . 5 . 2003 to show it to a doctor .

later on , there was another Panchayat in respect of property in which lands were partitioned .
however , for more than four years , the delinquent has been successfully avoiding criminal prosecution .
15- Subject to the above direction , the appeal and the interlocutory application are disposed of .
with these two basic formalities attending to pension , the option to pension was very high .
thus , the petitioner takes the stand that he had completed the formalities on his behalf .
no separate sentence has been passed under Section 364 - A / 120 B IPC .
5- The prosecution , in order to prove its charge , has examined the following witnesses .
when she replied yes , she had taken the money and also took the surplus case .
at the time of giving money , Bina Devi and Mamta Devi were also sitting there .
he identified Vijay Yadav as the person who had abducted his brother Sagar from the rickshaw .
11- PW5 is the victim of the incident and he is able to understand the matter .
thereafter , he took her to a temple where a girl and two persons were sitting .
later on , her father had come to Haldani and returned with his father to Kahalgaon .
PW5 ( victim ) and his younger sister PW4 Riya Kumari are witnesses to the occurrence .
the Superintendent of Police , Bhagalpur has informed that the aforesaid case is still under investigation .
Maniniyya Seema Ali Khan , J. Hon'ble Ganga Bilshun Shah Vs . State of Bihar
4- The name of counsel PW-1 , Rai , is recorded in the first information report .
PW-6 states that after he went with the appellant , they were residing at several places .
it was alleged that once abuses and assault were made by the petitioner with the complainant .
after receipt of final report , the learned Magistrate had heard learned counsel for the complainant .
other allegations regarding construction of the house and placement of nada kuta and trees were denied .
( III ) any other point which may be raised at the time of final hearing .
since both the Courts below had misconstrued and misinterpreted the Ex.-C Government Circular and erroneously understood .
15 . as far as the notice is concerned , the same may be mentioned here .
in my opinion , the above mentioned injury resulted into death due to shock and haemorrhage .
10 . the doctor found two ounces half digested food in the stomach of the deceased .
he claimed to have seen the accused persons in the same place for the first time .

he also stated that Ravi Mahto had also taken him to the bank of the river .
after a journey of about one and a half hour , PW-13 inquired about the plant .
she also stated that during the abduction , Liberation and Dashrath were also living with her .
he also stated that he had gone to the local police station and about the occurrence .
he also stated that he had also not seen the accused persons prior to the incident .
Chameshwar Sah was arrested at 11.00 p.m. from his house and he received information on 07.12.2011 .
he further stated that no one had gone to the police station to search the accused .
PW-4 Kamal Kishore Chaudhary was neither the office bearer nor the Investigating Officer in this case .
the present case needs to be examined in the light of the constitutional propositions established above .
I did not see whether he was writing or not and I got my signature later .
from the aforesaid evidence , it appears that this witness had made statement before the police .
the effect of the evidence in this regard has to be considered by the Tribunal concerned .
he admits that he had come to the place of occurrence when he heard the cry .
she also admits that she had not received any bleeding injury at the time of occurrence .
20- Where a taxpayer had made an application to the Income-tax Officer for correcting a defect .
this Court had held to the Supreme Court that the petitioner will not be sent back .
the petitioners shall continue to function as Motor Vehicles Inspectors till the new appointments are made .
some of the payments made earlier were also mentioned by the High Court in its order .
after the expiry of his tenure , the post of Head also came to an end .
8- The prosecution , in order to prove its charge , has examined the following witnesses .
the dough was pushed into the joint condition and was part of the dross as well .
he also stated that he did not notice that Dinesh Choudhary was hurt in the head .
he has proved the endorsement on the fardbeyan which has been marked as Ext . 4 .
he has again taken the statement of the informator and has visited the place of occurrence .
he has stated that the Khagaria is at a distance of 5-6 kms from his village .
he denied that both the injured were their relations and the reports were collusive and uninappropriate .
it also appears that the incident has taken place near the house of both the parties .
when she had not returned in the evening , the family had started looking for her .
the courts below have recorded a categorical finding that the plaintiffs have possession of the property .
initially , a sandha was instituted which was later accepted as the fardbeyan of the informants .
the argument on behalf of the appellants is that the place of occurrence has been changed .
he had gone to the place of occurrence on hearing noise and had seen the incident .
9- PW5 Shiv Shankar Bhagat is the informant and one of the injured in this case .
therefore , the District Cooperative Office found it defective that the Committee of Management was in minority .
he then refers to Sub - law 26 framed for Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society ( PACS ) .
secondly , the present case was not a case of election of fresh members of the Committee .
5- In the defence , as many as eight witnesses have been produced but no documentary evidence .
PW-3 is not only one of the attesting witnesses but he is the son of the deceased .
the informator at that time was right in front of his house along with PW-3 Harendra Sah .
after the death , the fardbeyan was given , as a result of which case was registered .
Maheshwari Sah was killed by a stranger and the accused persons were dragged on account of enmity .
one side is that he was caught by Maheshwari and Maheshwari was stabbed in the same currency .
therefore , the necessary directions and instructions can be framed and issued within two months from today .
cognizance of the offence was taken and the matter was normally sent to the Court of Session .
this means that on the date of the incident , he must have been of 54 years .
Ram Bahadur Singh ( AW1 ) also signed both pages of the Will as a attesting witness .
6- In the result , the writ petition has to fail and the same is accordingly dismissed .
( b ) that he becomes the whole or part of the resources of a terrorist organisation .
AIR 1980 SC 326 : ( 1980 ) 1 SCC 554 : 1980 ( Cri . ) .
taking fairness with the learned G.P. 3 , he states that in fact it was 13 office .
thus , the order of the Divisional Commissioner disfiguring the Panel had lost its importance and validity .
three additional posts have been sought to be entered into which persons appointed on contract are working .
as a result of the said suit , compromise / compromise had taken place between the parties .
however , he did not contest the claim made on behalf of the father of the petitioners .
the private respondents No. 4 to 8 claim to be the purchaser from the original land holders .
when he tried to intervene , he was assaulted by Surya Narayan Jha along with his father .
the office is directed to return the records of the lower court forthwith to the concerned Court .

when the bus reached near Godara village , there was a procession of Muharram on the road .
2- The plaintiffs-respondents had filed the aforesaid suit for decree for specific execution of contract dated 01.12.1986 .
9- Now , we deal with the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant .
11- Once the false principle in all is found to be inapplicable by a number of decisions .
the trial court also does not appear to be very inclined to proceed with the criminal prosecution .
Amit Kumar was being taken to Motipur Hospital for treatment , but he died on the way .
13- PW-7 Ashok Moto is the second investigating officer of the case who had submitted the charge-sheet .
3- Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he was an applicant in the category of disability .
respondent No.6 did not participate in the counselling and was not entitled to be considered for appointment .
access to justice is neither swift and cheap nor does it diminish the burden of the court .
it has already been examined that it will not serve any purpose , if it is done .
once the order was passed by the Tribunal , perhaps there was no option with the head .
Mandhata Singh , J. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the Views .
needless to say , the appellant did not have a licence to open any such manufacturing unit .
after the trial , the appellants have been convicted and accused Om Prakash Yadav has been acquitted .
this witness has been examined in detail , but the defence has failed to rebut his evidence .
the veena Devi , the goddess of worship and the Mamta Devi had become lighter with her .
he was at his house and he learnt that his grandson was missing from the Sagar Rickshaw .
after defraying the ransom , his son had returned from Farakka train on 25.5.2002 with his grandson .
thus , there is inconsistency in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses on this point as well .
he is demanding an amount of Rs . 25 lacs through mobile phone no.9878433782 of his house .
PW1 and others had crossed the river and had taken further at the instance of Krishna Yadav .
Krishna Yadav could , however , be traced and saw Sardar and Bhola in the sugarcane field .
he charges the fare and drove the person to the river that he wanted to go there .
he also identified the attested copy of the Station Diary entry No.121 ( Ext . Ka-2 ) .

having liberated himself , he went to Bagha Station and climbed the train in the middle night .
he has narrated about the number of calls to be outside Ravindra Singh's Mobile No. 9878633782 .
48 . ( 2010 ) 1 SCC 573 : ( 2010 ) 1 SCC ( Cri . )
2- The first information report was instituted on the basis of fardbeyan of PW-5 Arun Kumar Thakur .
PW-3 is the brother of the informant-in-law and he claims to be an eyewitness to the incident .
9- PW-1 Ramadhar Thakur , in his examination-in-chief , has supported the allegations levelled against the appellants .
hence , I find that the aforesaid case would not apply to the facts of this case .
he claims that he had not seen any injury sustained by anybody except a far away status .
thus , this Court finds that the evidence of PW1 is not reliable for the aforesaid reasons .
he admits that when he reached the place of occurrence , accused persons were not present there .
according to this witness , he found the waist of hundreds of live hans covered with blood .
thereafter , all the aforesaid accused persons had quarrelled with the informant-in-law as well as her brothers .
thereafter , all the accused armed with different weapons had gone to the west running the bullets .
the prosecution wanted that Dinesh Choudhary should construction his wall while leaving the path for the prosecution .
all the other vises were medium within the heart , lungs , liver , kidney and spleen .
he had taken the dead body of ( DW-1 ) and other Manoj Chaudhary to the hospital .
he also stated that the prosecution was chasing his father when he was running towards Soving Road .
on the statement of his father , Khagaria , Police Station Case No.173 of 2002 was instituted .
in his cross-examination , he has admitted that he is one of the accused in this case .
she has denied the suggestion that Manoj Chaudhary had died on account of bullet fired by Pankaj .
( IV ) Inflammation and redness of about 2 " x1 / 1 " on the back .
the main ground given by the learned trial court is that the gun shot was not repeated .
if a man dies by firing a shot , then there is no question of firing again .
the main ground given by the trial court is that the shot of pistol was not repeated .
when a person is killed by the same shot , there is no question of shooting again .
21- Thus , I do not find any fault with the impugned order allowing the amendment petition .
joint of right wrist - radious with lower part of radius and ulna ( right wrist ) .
he has been questioned as to the entire period during which she was away from the house .
the material question of law , therefore , deserves to be answered in favour of the appellant .
as far as title is concerned , the authorities have no jurisdiction to judge or refer it .
therefore , the material question framed of law does not arise for trial in this second appeal .
this witness had allegedly come to his shop which is very close to the place of occurrence .
even then , it is apparent that the claimants have not made any representation on the point .
6- The prosecution , in order to prove its case , examined as many as 13 witnesses .
Tana Devi , her daughter , had accompanied appellants Hbari Devi alias Kanti Devi and Indu Devi .
she had obtained permission from her mother and thereafter had gone with her to see the movie .
no demand was made and due to the negligence of the deceased she had received accidental burn injuries .
on a request made by learned counsel for the petitioner , the matter was adjourned for four weeks .
8- The inquest report and the post mortem report were brought on record vide Exh.5 and Ext.2 respectively .
Mahasweta Sah ( since deceased ) , brother of the informant , was having meals at a chowki .
Maheshwari Sah was taken to the hospital as he was injured but died on account of his injuries .
as a matter of fact , there was no light and identification of the accused was not possible .
16- We have analysed the entire evidence of the witnesses which has always been on the same side .
the villagers are used to work in the night and their eyes are able to work with light .
PW-5 also found the prosecution case mentioned in Sashwan Police Station Case No. 37 / 02 as true .
of these five witnesses , three , namely , PWs 1 , 2 and 3 are eye witnesses .
9- From the prosecution evidence it appears that PWs 1 , 2 and 3 are the eye witnesses .
4- The challenge raised before the learned single Judge to the decision of the lower authority has failed .
she also picked up the chappals of the appellants and accused Nwal Kishore Sharma ( since deceased ) .
a 'closure' was called in that area to protest against such act of the political person .
it was allowed on 6.7.2012 and the date of execution of the will was assumed to be 8.8.2006 .
this witness has also stated that wife of the testatrix also signed the Will as a attesting witness .
as a member of the Legislative Council , he was allotted a plot in Kautilya Nagar of Patna .
( a ) it is intended to be used in relation to the purposes of any terrorism ; or
the revision case No.82 of 1987-88 was dismissed by order contained in Annexure 11 filed by the petitioners .
3- The defendant first party had filed a countervailing written statement denying the entire case of the plaintiff .
the subsequent document whether Ex.5 or Ex.7 / A is with respect to municipal survey plot number 3448 .
it is not denied that Ex.7 and Ex.7 / A are not in respect of the suit property .
the informant , who had reached the spot of accident , found his son dead under esoteric circumstances .
hence , the appeal has come up for the appellant , Mr. Ujjwal Kumar Sinha , learned counsel .
the suit property is a house standing in plot no.209 of the property bearing area of two Kathas .
now the matter will proceed only to the female appellant , namely , Tara Devi , survived alone .
investigation was kept pending against the appellants No. 2 and other nominated accused persons , Ballia and Kurban .
further , neither the doctor nor the Investigating Officer has been examined and has also caused serious prejudice .
the above named sole appellant is discharged of the liability of the bail bond submitted on his behalf .
several other reasons are being provided to merely covers the failure of the State to appoint the petitioner .
hence , the case is based on the evidence of only one witness / victim Madan Mohan Jha .
after reaching there , she saw a quarrel between the women members and the children she had stopped .
Pratap Narayan Jha , Nandabhusan Jha , Arvind Jha , along with others , were nominated as witnesses .
12- On the other hand , learned counsel for the State supported the order of the courts below .
20- The revision petition , thus , is found to be devoid of merits and is accordingly dismissed .
if it resulted in financial injury to them or would not be a ingredients of a criminal offence .
thereafter it was made over to the investigating authority but it has not been found to be supported .
on receipt of reply , District Magistrate , Saharsa had cancelled the licence on 21st February , 2008 .
he has submitted that the order dated 21.02.2008 referred to above was never communicated to the writ petitioner .
his claim could not be allowed on the ground that the said order was not received by him .
5- We shall also mention that we have checked the copies of the answer sheets placed on record .
in such a situation , I could find it dangerous to stay at Barhiya in a victim state .
in fact , the petitioner has force over the merits of the charge in the entire writ petition .
this will also be apparent from the excerpt of his explanation which has also been underlined for clarity .
he also stated that he was sent to the hospital from the police station where he was treated .
the appellant is on bail , therefore , he is discharged from the liabilities of his bail bonds .
on appeal , the lower Appellate Court confirmed the finding of the Trial Court and dismissed the appeal .
Suo Singh , Batuku Singh , Deo Narain Singh , Naresh Singh , Dasharatha Singh were the Panch .
10 . it appears to us that the delinquent has made every effort to delay the criminal prosecution .
he was subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution but nothing material could be elicited from him in cross-examination .
the version described in the fardbayan is not supported by any of the prosecution witnesses in the Court .
both these writ petitions are admitted for final disposal at this stage with the consent of the parties .
2- Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsels for the Punjab National Bank ( Bank ) .
the result is that the whole object is going to be futile for which the tribunal was constituted .
the court at this stage has no meaning as to whether the petitioner has any defence or not .
whether respondent No.6 participated in the mansing or not is also not of much importance at this stage .
8- While issuing notice to respondent No.6 at this stage , it would not serve any useful purpose .
10- To set aside the impugned order , it would be necessary to send notice to respondent No.6 .
14- The Court directs the Principal Secretary to Department of Education to forward a copy of this order .
after about 12 - 13 days telephone calls were made asking for ransom for release of the ocean .
he has been cross-examined in detail , but the defence has not been able to belittle his evidence .
12- A copy of this order be sent to Chief Judicial Magistrate , Bhagalpur , for necessary action .
it is submitted that in fact witnesses have not been able to make out a case of kidnapping .
Vs . State of Bihar and another Cri.M.C.No. 112018 of 2010 . decided on 10th October , 2012 .
after repeated requests , the petitioner had not treated a sick cow at the later stage of surgery .
it is a question of fact and , therefore , cannot be allowed at the second appellate stage .
Exh.4 is a formal FIR , Exh.5 is the inquest report and Ext . 6 is case diary .
it was disclosed in para 14 that accused persons had fired shots from a distance of 15-16 yards .
after the trial , the appellants have been convicted and sentenced as aforesaid by the learned trial court .
he had given the written report , to the officer-in-charge of the police station , to the effect .
on the same day , he had gone to Ravindra Singh's house at Mandi Govinda Garh .
10- On 12.12.2011 , his statement was taken before the Magistrate , which has been noted as Exhibit-3 .
thereafter , PW-8 Krishna Yadav and his two companions had left and reached the bank of the river .
Krishna and his companions used to hounce on him at intervals of 3 to 4 hours every day .
his statement was also recorded by the Magistrate which has been exhibited as Exh . 3 / 3 .
in his cross-examination , he has stated that Krishna Yadav had asked him to install a rolling machine .
he also stated that the accused were talking amongst themselves and were telling their names Bhola and Upendra .
it also appears that the appellants are members of a gang engaged in kidnap people to get ransom .
however , considering the nature of the crime , a liberal punishment cannot be awarded to the appellants .
6- PW-3 Mohd . Shamim Akhtar had stated that he is not an eye witness of the incident .
therefore , there appears to be an discrepancy in the manner in which PW-6 has described the occurrence .
this was done because the right of the petitioners to be absorbed was sufficiently taken up long ago .
the State authority was sleeping on the matter , whereby the petitioners were constrained to approach this court .
24 . it is not necessary to say that their regularization will be understood from the same date .
subsequently , payments have been made in her favour on about 4 different occasions from 25-2009 to 8.2.2012 .
despite such findings , the petitioner being the head of the Gram Panchayat had taken steps for payment .
finally , SDO has been substituted for the name of Chapra as will appear from Appendix - 27 .
he has stated that it is not a fact that the occurrence had taken place as an accident .
( I ) Externally blood and clots on the scalp , and in the area of the neck .
it was properly named and sealed in a Wall and handed over to the police for necessary action .
based on the fardbeyan of accused Dinesh Choudhary , Khagaria Police Station Case No.173 of 2002 was instituted .
( III ) inflammation , tenderness and abrasion about 1 % x1 / 1 over right shoulder joint .
injuries No. 1 , III and IV are injuries of ordinary nature caused by hard and blunt object .
the agreement must at least presume the existence of the person on whose behalf it is being admitted .
PW2 denies that he had written the love letters and that he has those letters which he wrote .
the fact that he did not do so suggests that he was a part of the entire incident .
he has specifically stated that there were two suitcases of different sizes in the room of the hotel .
5- PW-1 Ram Mohan Jha is nominated as a witness of the occurrence in the first information report .
the statement given in the cross examination indicates that he is not an eye witness to the incident .
all such factors indicate that no case is made out under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code .
none of the issues of permanence or any fraud committed by the claimant has been raised by the railways .
in para 13 , he states that the deceased was residing there for the last five to six years .
therefore , the prosecution has succeeded in proving that Maheshwari Sah died within twenty hours of the post-mortem examination .
the entire incident was seen in the light of the electric bulb which was burning at the relevant time .
informant's husband had reached near the farm of Nand Kishore Singh at about 6 : 30 am .
16- The case of the prosecution is that PW-5 had gone with his companions to ploughing the aforesaid land .
Gauri Shankar Lal had typed Will which was read by the testator , whereafter , he signed the will .
the witness identified his signatures on the Will ( marked as Exts . 6 and 6 / 1 ) .
it has also been stated that when the Will was executed , the testator was physically and mentally fit .
she has stated that when the Will was executed by her father , she was physically and mentally well .
the will dated 8.8.2006 ( 1 ) is also a pure will and the last will of the testator .
the Geo - tax Survey Khatiyan ( Ext . D ) is also not related to the suit property .
( the disputed portion undernoted by me has already been deleted by the earlier preliminary order dated 18.02.2010 ) .
but not as a casual case , merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the local police .
the owner of the aforesaid land had sold the land to the appellant under a sale deed dated 28.02.2002 .
according to the appellant , the land belonged to a common ancestor and the appellant was also a co-sharer .
it is argued that defendant's own house in Plot No. 897 and 901 was broken up in 1998 .
he submits that a conclusion to this effect can be seen in paras 29 to 33 of the judgment .
13- I have heard learned counsels for the parties and I have gone through the materials available on record .
according to the learned counsel , the issue of title should not have been looked into by the Court .
the evidence led by the defendant is as follows : - A and A / 1 are the diary .
decided on 31st July , 2013 and other CW . J . C . no . 10506 of 2008 .
4- There are several facts which both the parties have furnished which in fact makes the cases totally misconceived .
to fill these posts , the selection process was completed and finally a panel of 19 persons was made .
8- Thus , the argument that the petitioner did not come to this Court is devoid of any meaning .
further G.P. 3 also submits that there are several orders of this Court and several persons have been appointed .

Hon'ble D. N. PATEL, J. Basic Fuels Pvt. Ltd. Versus Bihar State Credit & Investment Corporation Ltd. & Ors. W.P. (C) No. 1717 of 2011. Decided on 3rd May, 2011.
He was accompanied by his Counsel at the time of filing his election petition and that the petitioner had himself presented the petition to the authorized officer of this Court.
I further find from the documents which are exhibited by the defence specially Exhibit B which shows that the land in dispute is recorded in the name of Bihari Mahato.
Last but not the least, the submission of the petitioner is that the punishment awarded is disproportionate to the act of delinquency and, therefore, it is liable to be reduced.
even in the said title suit , both Bhagwan Singh and Surendra Singh had deposed in favour of Shambhu Nath Singh , son - in - law of the deceased .
it is the case of the plaintiff that considering the requirement of the defendant , they had rented a house for rent of Rs . 250 / - per month .
according to the defendant , the parties were descended from a common ancestor Govind Singh , who had three sons , Mahavir Singh , Ram Sewak Singh and Bahadur Singh .
the name of Bahadur Singh , ancestor of the plaintiff , is present and the defendant's acceptance is that the plaintiff is a descendant descended from Bahadur Singh .
from the evidence of this witness , it appears that at the time of the incident , he was at a distance of ten cubits from the procession of Muharram .
it is apparent that there has been some delay due to some confusion in the communication on the part of the investigating agency , which is a monitoring investigation Bureau .
in his opinion , death was caused due to ante mortem injury caused by firearms , in respect of which the death was caused as a result of brain injury .
the case of the plaintiff , in brief , is that the suit property was disposed of by the erstwhile land owner in favour of the father of the plaintiff .
in my opinion , in these circumstances , the decision of the Supreme Court , namely , AIR 1957 SC 133 , is fully applicable in the case at hand .
however , the position would be different where there is no dispute or there is a consensus amongst the parties making the contract with regard to the breach of conditions .
there is not even a whisper of apology or explanation in the counter affidavit as to why the Board officials did not consider it necessary to proceed with the representation .
it is only PW-1 who has come up to support the prosecution case , who is not a nominated witness in the FIR , who is also a stark one .
Hon'ble Mhir Kumar Jha , J. in Biresh Prasad Vs . State of Bihar and others , CWJC No. 8654 of 2008 . decided on 19th March , 2012 .
therefore , with the cumulative effect of the discrepancies and inï¬rmities on record , the findings recorded by the trial court cannot be said to be supportive of the matter .
the object of raising a further reasoning on the praiseworthy principle mentioned in Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act is based on the exclusion of such a transferor .
hence , even in the presence of some contradictions in the deposition of the prosecution witnesses , the aforesaid contradictions do not go to the root of the prosecution case .
in particular , in the event , when there was a land dispute between the parties and the above appellants did not do anything at the time of the incident .
in my view , the residential requirement seen in the advertisement is the actual residential accommodation of the applicant in the concerned district and is not a legally owned residence .
the Registrar General of this Court , on failure , shall take action by way of any of the routes provided in section 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure .
3- According to the case of the plaintiffs , Ramji Dubey used to be the common ancestor of the joint family from which the plaintiffs and the defendants were concerned .
advocate . - Mr . workmen , applies to any number of applications ; M / s / SDA operating Dyes , Dheermm , Turanincorporated , openet amm , etc .
the plaintiff is running his business at the most appropriate and convenient place , which is a large shop located in the main site of the embroidery of Sujganj market .
why would the wife and son of the deceased , who were present at the time of the incident , try to implicate the innocent rather than the real culprits .
therefore , it would not be proper to look at the evidence in doubt but the correct attitude has to be appreciated for the reasons on which it is based .
the incident occurred on 19 . 10 . 1986 at about 10 to 11 : 00 a . m . , that is to say , the day is grueling .
Hon'ble Kishore Kumar Mandal , J. Hon'ble Renu Devi vs. State of Bihar and others , CWJC No. 2099 of 2013 . decided on 15th April , 2014 .
according to the plaint , defendant No. 2 is the only creditor of the name of defendant No. 1 , who was a temporary purchaser under the conditional sale deed .
it is unfortunate that competition in the matter of elections for the post of a village chief and serious crimes such as those of the State should not be punished .
the incident place is the verandah of the informant and door , which is in the northern side of village , Dharampur , Bhathpur , P.S. Puusa , District Samastipur .
9 . admittedly , in the instant case , the partition proceedings were going on before the institution of the suit and it is an admitted case of the parties .
it is not the case of the appellant that the findings of the courts below are contrary to the evidence available on record or are without any evidence on record .
it would be better for him to necessitate documentary identification by the government or semi - government authorities and to make a brief description of it in the order sheet .
after the discussion , the motion will be voting on the same day , which will be conducted by the District Magistrate in the prescribed manner by secret ballot . 
at the relevant time , the share of the marketing secretary and the Assistant Director was in the cadre of the second category and were of the same pay scale .
she was married to the second wife three sons , viz . , Moinuddin , Faziluddin , Badruddin , Badruddin and three daughters , the Femas , Asul and Moista .
the aforesaid conduct probabilises the version of the defence and on account of that , the conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial court deserves to be set aside .
on the other hand , the totality of the effect generated by the candidate on the interview body can give a more accurate picture of the candidate's personality .
(87 ) . coming to the merits and demerits of this appeal , Mr. Giri has , on two grounds , assailed the order of the learned Single Judge .
Hon'ble Mhir Kumar Jha , J. : Manju Kumari vs. State of Bihar and Ors . , CWJC No. 3199 of 2012 . decided on 16th May , 2014 .
in our opinion , it is only the duty of the State Government and the State Government to appoint the authority for the purpose of Section 44 of the Act .
the most important question , therefore , is that John BX's property , i . e . her four annas will go to Khyat or to Jamal Hussain .
thereafter , the petitioner had contested the election of Head of the Village Panchayat , Bagheli in the year 2006 , which was reserved for a highly backward female candidate .
2- The petitioners M / s Sh . Ram Fulds and Fertilizers Industries , New Delhi , Sekadpur , Muzaffarpur are the godown manager and the clerk respectively of Muzaffarpur .
the location of the acquired land has not been taken into consideration , which is very close to the Sasaram - Chuh Road and is within the Sasaram Municipal area .
due to the fact that there has been a violation of the mandatory clause of the law , therefore , it is justified to convict the appellant at that point .
this may appear to be some of the more attractive if one takes into account the general concept of reservation in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes .
( see para 23 of the judgment ) , therefore , it is necessary for the State to point out the period for which the reservation shall remain in force .
in such view of the matter the right way of choosing the multiplier is the age of the deceased as there would be certainty regarding the age of the deceased .
in the submission of the petitioners , the State Government , after the commencement of the recruitment process , had altered the principle of adverse selection to the writ petitioners .
at the time of occurrence , the informator along with his brother deceased Shailendra Singh was engaged in plantation of paddy in the outer area of the village at Noampri .

the information of the meetings of the accused-Satyanarayana is adjoining to the west of the informant and further there is open ground and there was a dispute for the same .
it was stated that the Bihar Public Works Department , which handled the work load , has been amended in the Code of Bihar and the relevant Rules of 2005 .
according to the petitioners , all these powers are derived from the provisions of Section 15 and Rule of the Act along with the guidelines issued by the Central Government .
this amount will be recovered by the head from the wages of the appellants , and will be used for the purpose of improving the facilities in the affiliated schools .
in the appeal filed before him , the Chancellor had taken the view that the Vice-Chancellor should have been discussed in the context of the arguments presented by the appellant .
according to the only respondent , the lands are the valuable lands and are situated between the bequest of the city and also near the market place on Roza Road .
31 . that too , in law , is not difficult to comprehend the consequences of the compliance of any mandatory requirement stipulated in a higher law like the Constitution .
the learned single Judge was , therefore , right in holding that the charge would be in accordance with the domestic duty and not in accordance with the commercial charges .
for them there will be a difference in the date but the profit will be as much as they have been given who has passed through the first attempt . 
the Court concerned could , on the one hand , appreciate the merits and demerits of the final report and on the other , take a decision in this behalf .
the practical course has to be set aside both orders which are apparently illegal and then it has to be ensured that the decision is made in accordance with law .
without going into unnecessary details , it may be said that the first legislative measure in India was the enactment of the Advocates' Council of India Act , 1926 .
it will be kept in mind that if an inquiry has been initiated by the District Magistrate , a report of the result will be sent to him for information .
9- The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Supreme Court of India , 2014 ( 2 ) SCC 788 , in paras 30 and 31 has held as under :
the more frequent and far - reaching means of transgressing the privacy will make it possible to hear it on the road , which in near proximity has been whispered .
it is evident from the observation that the first information in this case is the evidence of the involvement of the murder case against the accused / appellant Veena Devi .
the actual proof of harassment is to be the proof of harassment , the mere mental harassment of the concerned authorities is not intended to be incorporated in the section .
as regards the witness being the sister of Barhiya's wife , the evidence of this witness is not in accordance with Section 50 / 60 of the Evidence Act .
the occupant himself had gone to the spot and found that the disputed house is in the possession of the appellant , in which he is running a grocery shop .
in fact , she used to sit on the table where , with the consent of the petitioner , the counsel used to sit and preside over the union members .
if the pleadings , arguments and even word 'evidence' are translationthen it has to be kept out of the ambit of cross-examination otherwise the consequences would be inconceivable .

9- Having heard the arguments of all the parties , I have also gone through the record and the judgments and the provisions referred to on behalf of the parties .
but , in my opinion , the argument put up by the learned counsel for the State as well as the private respondent is hit by bad and statutory provisions .
in terms of entry 52 of the COPA and the Union List , the area covered by the declaration therein is not the same as covered by the Food Act .
where , on certain grounds , the competent authority has been given power to remove the general or the Speaker , as the case may be , at certain points .

in the instant case , the charges have not been framed as the petitioner was not given the cause notice , then the attempt of the necessary enquiry would be futile .
thus , while disputing the title of the plaintiff on the suit land , the defendant made such a submission that in fact , he had title over the suit land .

4- On a cogent analysis of the materials , the learned Magistrate was of the opinion that the witnesses had different statements , there was a land dispute between the parties and the allegation was false .
for the aforesaid reasons , I find sufficient merit in the submission of the petitioner that the impugned order in the writ petition as well as the election petition itself deserves to be quashed / rejected .
the informant , Narora , came back to the village and saw the dead body of his elder brother , which was kept at a post situated in the west of Sarju Sah's house .

on the basis of aforesaid discussions , I am of the opinion that the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence of conviction cannot be sustained in the eyes of law and it deserves to be set aside .
for the reasons aforementioned , the judgments and decrees of the Courts below do not suffer from any infirmity on the issue of court fees nor on the issue of Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act .
11- So far as the other two decisions , i . e . , AIR 1958 Patna 550 and AIR 1992 Patna 40 are concerned , they are not applicable to the facts of the present case .

the ratio laid down in the aforesaid two judgments is corroborated by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Balbhadra Prasad Singh vs. State of Bihar (2010 ( 3 ) PLJR 27 ) .
again , the involvement of the three acquitted accused persons , namely , Makhdum Ravindu Das , Nardmani Ravidas and Bhoole Ravichar , who allegedly had caught hold of the deceased from behind , was also rejected .
the first was of the year 1974 ; the second incident was of 1975 ; the next three events were of 1977 , and the remaining events were of the year 1978 , except the last event .
at that time , Vishwanath Thakur and Arun Kumar Sharma took a bag of Rs . 29285 / - in cash as well as a cheque of Rs . 12534 / - which were at the chowki .

Hon'ble Mhir Kumar Jha , J. Md . Maruf - Azam and Anr . vs State of Bihar and Ors . , reported in CWJC No. 13356 of 2013 . decided on 16th May , 2014 .
the respondents No. 2 , 3 and 4 respectively in the said Janardan Singh , Rajiv Singh and Ranjil Singh are the respondents in the present second appeal while plaintiff- Prafulla Chandra Gupta is respondent No. 1 .
in fact , even according to the written arguments submitted on behalf of the respondents , even treated as measured from the level of the road , the height of the building will increase to 54 centimeters .
similarly , even where a police officer does not record the information at all and does not inform the higher officer at all , it will also be a clear violation of Section 42 of the Act .
2 . the District Council is vested with the District Council on a fairly large portion of the land between the railway station on the one hand and the road to the railway station on the other .
now , undisputedly , except in the Aliwal district of Bihar , besides the other revenue districts of the State of Bihar , family courts and judicial systems have also been established in the district of Sheikhpura .

he submits that in view of the provisions contained in the Act also in view of the provisions contained in the Act , the registered owner is required to indemnify the claimant in the case of accident .
the said resolution has not been made applicable to persons employed in the Government of Bihar on deputation from public sector organisations or to employees working in day - to - day salaried or re - employment .
in this view of the matter , according to the learned counsel , it cannot be said that the assets acquired in the settlement by the execution of registered pigeons are the properties of the joint family .
this is the consequential action of terminating the said direction issued by the State Government and service rendered by the Regional Director of Animal Husbandry , which is the subject matter of challenge in every writ petition .
in the same paragraph , he denied the suggestion that on the day of occurrence also the Investigating Officer had come to the village of the place of occurrence and that he was concealing the said fact .
when we return to the cross examination , the question is directly put to him that he was well known to the deceased accused Ramanuja Singh and appellant Dina Nath Singh as he was a close relative .
in the facts and circumstances of the case , within the aforesaid period of three months , I impose the cost of Rs . 1 lac to the petitioner to be paid by the State of Bihar .
the presence of Arsad Mian at the place of incident in the evening , who is concerned with the deceased and is at a distance of 22 kms from the place of incident , is also doubtful .
however , the learned Tribunal has calculated the compensation amount on the basis of the income of the deceased , which was the branch manager in North Bihar Regional Rural Bank at the time of the accident .
therefore , even when there is admission on behalf of the defendant , the plaintiff would not be free from the need to prove the disputed facts , if such a direction is given by the Court .
in this regard , every case , before making provision for reservation to the concerned State , must show the compelling reasons , namely , backwardness , inadequacy of representation and the existence of overall administrative efficiency .
these judgments are relevant to the extent that they define the power of the Court at the stage of the charge and , therefore , it is necessary to bear in mind the same as the guidelines .
2- In this very stage , for the final disposal of the writ petition , I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the State and perused the records .
in such a view of the matter it is very difficult to record any finding regarding convenience of the parties on these common grounds or the valuation of the property or the allotment made by the road .
it has come to the notice of the learned Single Judge that cancellation had taken place on the basis of Panchayat Elections 2006 which started and also that the petitioner was an accused in a criminal case .

in other words , there was a ban on the right of the widow to transfer the property and for that reason the same was called the life estate of a limited owner or a widow .
from a perusal of the entire evidence led by the plaintiff as well as by the defendants , I am of the opinion that the witnesses of the plaintiff-petitioner have not been able to prove the same .
learned counsel for the respondents has placed reliance on para 37 of the judgment of the culprit ( supra ) , reliance has also been placed on the same judgment by the learned counsel for the appellant .
the definition of non social element as contained in Section 2 ( d ) of the Act reads as follows : " 2 ( d ) " an antisocial element means a person who is

2. At the time of occurrence, number of persons residing in the vicinity of the house assembled but the appellants namely, Rajiv Nayan Singh and Ram Lakhan Singh did not come over there though they were in the shop which situated in the ground floor of the same building.
Therefore, we want a positive line of action from the respondents who may take up the matter with the help of the officers of the Chhatisgarh as well as with the officers of the respondent Union of India and its officers, including Water Resources Department of Union of India.
8. We considered the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the facts of the case in the light of the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as in the light of the provisions made in the Bihar Control of Crimes Act, 1981.
according to him , as per the informant , being a woman of PW3 , there was no justification for entering the field for measurement of land and as a matter of fact , PW3 had come to the spot along with an officer in-charge of Sauwan Police Station .
the learned single Judge referred the matter to the Division Bench because he was of the opinion that the punishment which could be imposed on the opposition Nos. 2 to 18 in view of the High Court Rules was within the competence of the Division Bench of the Court .
the gift deed executed by Munni Yadav regarding share of the land allotted by him in his favour , to his daughter-in-law , namely , gift deed executed on 01.04.1954 in favour of the mother of the plaintiff no.4 , is an evidence of a partition in the past .
when he had returned from his rickshaw , the sister of the victim , Riya Kumari , was sitting alone , who told her that two persons had come there and given beating to the sea and had told her that her father was calling him at the station .
in the instant case , the plaintiff had filed an application for the settlement in which he had clearly stated that in the present day he is working as a military worker in the air force but he is a member of the backward class ( Schedule 1 ) .
the learned trial court has come to the conclusion , on the examination of the oral and documentary evidence led by the parties , that the plaintiff was able to prove his case on the issues and was accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant .
it was further submitted that even though the case was accepted as a case falling within the category of circumstantial evidence , the chain of events was found missing and on account of that , the finding recorded by the learned trial Court appears to be a mechanical conclusion .
he further submits that from the date of filing of the claim , the law on the point regarding payment of interest on the compensation amount is well settled , but in the instant case the learned Tribunal has directed to pay interest from the date of the order .
7- It would be relevant to mention here that after an opportunity has been given to the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the State of Bihar and its functionaries , no counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the State of Bihar and its officers .
clause 32 of the prosecution Manual states that the Assistant prosecution officer shall be a gazetted Government servant of the second class and the same shall be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Bihar Public Service Commission on a requisition made by the Department of Police .
21- In our opinion , the power to suspend or cancel a licence granted by sub-clause ( ii ) of clause 7 of the 2007 order is equal to the power to suspend or cancel a licence under sub-clause ( i ) of clause 11 of the 1984 order .
this aspect of the matter has been well settled in a recent judgment of the Apex Court in the case of B. Shashikala Vs . the State represented by the Superintendent of Police , reported in ( 2012 ) 9 SCC 771 , wherein it was held as under :
the learned trial court , on the basis of the evidence presented in the course of trial , had come to a conclusion with reference to Issue No . ( iv ) , that there was relationship of the landlord and the tenant between the plaintiff and the defendants .

advocate , M / s , Mehantu Samshaw , Assismhnea , e . F . App . , App . 82 ; Mr . s . N . Approved , or Respd . , J. Heard learned counsel for the appellants and learned Public Prosecutor for the State .
it is now well settled that while construing a deed , not only the intention of the parties to the deed is to be seen , but also equally relevant factor as to whether the intention of the parties is reflected from the averments in the deed or not .
4- The defence of the appellants was of false implication , of innocence and also that due to enmity the appellants and others were falsely implicated , though on that day , some unknown dacoits committed dacoity with the murder along with the house of lending by the accused .
( a ) ( i ) Xth or equivalent certificate , if available , and in the absence of which , ( i ) the date of birth certificate ( other than the Plutary School ) from the school for first entry , and in the absence of which ;
however , there was a contrary version / statement of the concerned Head and Panchayat Secretary that as per the record , the respondent - Punam Kumari , Gangara did not attend the complex in the village Panchayat , where the petitioner Mamta Kumari had appeared at Uncininga .
31- The plaintiffs have stated in para 8 of the plaint that at the time of vesting of Zamindari in the State of Bihar under the Bihar Land Reforms Act in 1956 , return in respect of the suit land was filed in the name of the Wakf estate .
3- Learned counsel also submits , with reference to the definition of the expression party as defined in Section 2 ( 1 ) ( h ) of the Act that the expression one party means a party to an arbitration agreement and no one else .
the liberty granted to the plaintiff to recover the amount of decree by way of an execution case against the defendants is clearly an erroneous direction which should have no effect on the rights of the parties under the law as laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure .
10- With regard to the aforesaid propositions , learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of first Secretary , State of Karnataka and others vs. Uma Devi ( 3 ) and others : ( 2006 ) 4 SCC 1 .
in the FIR as well as during the course of the evidence of PW5 , who is the victim , there is a specific disclosure that he had resisted , yet the rape was committed after the recording of her garment by force on the point of a pistol .
this witness has stated in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his cross-examination that it is not correct that there are two parties in his village , one side is that of Suresh Prasad Singh , father of Mani Kant Singh and the other is that of Arjun Prasad Singh .
if only the selection is to be made on the basis of oral examination , the issue flow should be maintained unaltered by all the members under different headings at the prescribed scales and the average should be the actual marks obtained by the candidate in an oral examination .
84 . I have also carefully examined the related aspect as to whether the view taken by a Division Bench headed by the Hon'ble Renu Kumari Pandey in the case of Smt . Renu Kumari Pandey ( supra ) has ever been questioned by any other Division Bench .
the requirement of exercise of power under Section 16 of the Prevention of Corruption Act or under Section 102 of the Code is that there should be a direct connection between the amount put in the account and the offence alleged to have been committed by the concerned person .
he had completed the investigation and a case under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 27 of the Arms Act , 1959 was found to be correct against the accused persons , namely , Surender Mehto , Manoj Mahto and Birendra Mahto .
8- It is further argued that the impugned order passed by the Collector is in violation of the direction of the Supreme Court in the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil and another vs. Additional Commissioner , Tribal Development and Others (( 1994 ) Supreme Court Cases 241 ) .
( 1973 ) 3 SCC 219 , Shivaji vs. State of Maharashtra , ( 1980 ) It has been held in that judgment that the High Court has full power to review the scope of the evidence in which the order of acquittal was passed by the Sessions Court .
( IV ) Coming to the trial court , on the basis of its appraisal of evidence on record , had come to the conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove that there was a relationship of the landlord and the tenant between the plaintiff and the defendants .
from a perusal of the Exh.15 series it appears that a certain amount has been sent in the name of the plaintiff and towards the plaintiff on behalf of Janardan Singh ( Janardan Transport Transport Agency ) , which also shows the relationship of the landlord and the tenant .
2- The case of the prosecution is based on the fardbeyan ( since deceased ) as recorded by the Station Officer incharge at Police Station on 10.09.1989 at about 6.45 p.m. , the fardbeyan being based on the fardbeyan ( as recorded by the bride market police station ) .
in support of his argument , the learned counsel has relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Makassan vs. State of U.P. and Bishan Kumar Singh vs. State of Bihar ( supra ) reported in ( 1998 ) 1 SCC 218 .
in the present case , the incident being a result of communal violence in the Bhagalpur city of the incident , it has to be understood that having lost her son , the first priority of the informator and the security of himself and other members of his family .
thus , from the date of inspection , till the date of the passing of the order , it was not conveyed to the Prescribed Authority that the company is a registered dealer and has submitted the original registration certificate in the Pataliputra Circle for the purpose of amendment .
36- In the case of Vaddebuina Tulasamma vs. Vaddeboyina Sesha Reddy ( AIR 1977 SC 1944 ) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the words to possess itself imply the state of ownership or to be in his or her hands or under power .
a copy of this order may be handed over to Mr. Mukesh Kumar Thakur , learned counsel for the State Election Authority for the distribution of the same among all those associated with the election to be started with the concerned Election Officer - cum - Block Development functionaries .
8- The petitioner is also claiming to be the Chairman of the Duniya Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Society and also of the Sonapur Trade Mandal Cooperation Committee ( a Central Co - operative Society ) and Bihar State Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited ( Apex Co - operative Society ) .
25 . in his brief reply to the arguments of Mr. Mangalam , Mr. Giri has submitted that the conclusion drawn by the learned Single Judge in paras 8 and 9 of the judgment passed in the case of Pawan Kumar Purave is a conclusion Absolute of the Rules .
whereas the complaint case is wholly pending on a notice relating to the appointment of the petitioner on 05.02.2003 , the enquiry report submitted by the Senior Deputy Collector supports his case in connection with the dismissal of the petitioner from service on account of continued absence from service .
11- From a perusal of para 14 of the impugned judgment , it appears that in the instant case , the Engineer had assessed the valuation of the acquired house at Rs . 54,999 / - which has been reduced by the Land Acquisition Judge without assigning any reason .
however , on the basis of this order , the petitioner shall not be reinstated to the post of Anganwadi Workers , but the reinstatement and consequential benefits of the petitioner shall be in accordance with the fresh order passed by the respondent / District Programme Officer , Patna .
indisputably , the judgment and order passed by the Credit Recovery Tribunal under Section 19 of the Act , 1993 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal is appealable under Section 20 of the Act , 1993 but the order of conditions was not passed with the consent of the parties .
the defendant has not been able to establish a settlement of the first batch , that is , in the year 1950 and similarly the claim of the defendant third group regarding settlement has not been proved , the defendant is not worthy of trust by the third group .
16- After a conjoint reading of the aforesaid two provisions of the Evidence Act , it reveals that the opponent has a liberty to accept the contrary in accordance with the procedure so prescribed , and the aforesaid acceptance would be capable of admission by any court of law .
the brother - in - law of Abdul Khalq , namely , Mohd . Ilias had communicated to the informator that since his son - in - law Abdul Khalq returned , he should meet the demand of a motorcycle and a cash of Rs . 50000 / - .
it may be due to a variety of reasons , such as neglect , carelessness , partiality , partiality , partiality , etc . , making public money more effective by the government officials , because in such a situation there is no one to give money or one .
according to the learned counsel , the land in question was settled by a former zamindar of Bettiah in favour of his father and the land in question since then was in his possession and after his death , the said land is in the possession of the petitioner .
34- Unfortunately , at the time of filing of the complaint , the implications and consequences are not properly seen by the complainant that due to such grievance , the complainant , the accused and his relatives may have been subjected to untold harassment , suffering and pain . 
as has been cross - examined by the only respondent , the approach of the Tribunal appears to be that as soon as a person takes the plea of partiality , the enquiry officer should be altered to the absolute of the materials on which such apprehension is based .
1 . for the purpose of providing speedy trial , the State Government shall , with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court , by notification in the Official Gazette , specify to be a special court for the trial of offences under this Act . 
a copy of the impugned order is on Annexure 6 to the writ petition and the order is purported to have been passed in the light of the judgment and order passed by this Court in CWJC number 17899 of 2012 ( Kanti Kumari vs. State of Bihar ) .
as there was a change in the administrative set - up in the State of Bihar , the situation became more complex and it was difficult for the State of Bihar to find a solution to the problem of filling up vacancies in the post of elementary school teachers .
it is also apparent from the aforesaid averments in the plaint that the express purpose of the plaintiff to seek the eviction of the defendant from the suit premises is to use it as a passage / exit gate to the middle portion of the building purchased by him .
14- In the instant case , the legal necessity had become infructuous by the plaintiffs having not completed their part of the contract and after receiving the payment of this agreement for sale , the buying of agricultural lands was left to be the sole dream of the defendants .
the test is as follows : The document is not a mature one , it has no testamentary effect , it is merely a statement of Hmoulded ( the testator , who had executed a will , like a will , reproduced in the present case ) .
( C ) prescribing forms in which pamphlets , entries and accounts shall be maintained by the office bearers of such Court ; ( d ) the tables of fees to be allowed to be sheeted , copies of orders and clerks and all office bearers of such Court :
10 . in case the writ petitioner / respondent herein has already applied for renewal of the lease and it has not been granted so far , it would be better for the State to proceed with the matter as soon as possible without further waiting for the State .
in a criminal case , which is the hidden object behind a weak prosecution , the very nature of the material on which the structure of the prosecution stands and the like constituent will justify the High Court's action in resetting the proceedings in the interest of justice .
the High Court , therefore , ought not to have directed the medical examination to be got conducted by a doctor posted in the High Court in the exercise of its power of judicial review and not merely on the basis of such report should have ordered his appointment .

I find myself in the submission made by the learned counsel for the opposition that the order passed by the learned Magistrate accepting the final form without notice to the notice given to the notice is not admissible and , therefore , the impugned order is hereby set aside .
3 . it is clear from the record of the lower court that the owner and the driver had failed to appear , however , the order of the record of the lower court is completely silent with regard to the fixing of the ex parte suit against them .
while the body of Lakshmi Devi was found at the lower storey in the room at the outstation under the mosquito nets , the body of her son was found in another room , lying under a mosquito nets lying in the bed under the blood of her son .

the learned senior counsel , therefore , submitted that on receipt of the communication relating to change of name the Inspector General , the only power of registration was to see that the proposed name is not in any way in the nature of the name of another Committee .
however , in arriving at this conclusion by this Court , the issue has no role to play that in an attempt to deprive them of the benefit of labour legislation , the entire work force of the petitioner organisation was brought on the roll of co - membership .
6- It has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that at the stage of taking cognizance , only one prima facie material was required to be seen from the learned Court below without holding the very intensive examination of the evidence of the witnesses as a trial court .
it is well settled that at the stage of taking cognizance , having regard to the rate of success of the prosecution in that particular case , the Court should not go into the merits of the case set up by them in the plaint filed by the police .
the State legislature is not devoid of its legislative power in respect of matters in the Concurrent List and , therefore , in relation to matters covered in the Concurrent List has the legislative competence to enact it , including the Code of Criminal Procedure , in the list .

At a particular stage of the incident, what is object of the unlawful assembly is a question of fact and that has to be determined keeping in view the nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the members and the behaviour of the members at or near the scene of incident."

then , under that circumstance , the subject of gossips by the farmers in the middle of the month of November is not only unacceptible but also improbable because of the fact that the normal habit of persons belonging to the village is to sleep quickly and have to get up early .

26- According to the discussions made above , due to the subsequent developments taking place during the pendency of this appeal due to the passage of time in the present case , in my opinion , it would be like to permit a dead horse to continue the case between the parties .

it was stated that as per the terms of the Mahabond , a sale deed was required to be executed on payment of the balance amount , i.e. , on payment of Rs . 25 , 000 , as a sale deed had already been paid for Rs . 15 , 000 .
18 . learned counsel for the appellant submitted that here the beneficiary Mehtath is not only Mahamaq but has also worked out to Sadhu and staffs as well as to the general public and , therefore , the beneficiary candidate is not a special group but the beneï¬ciaries belong to one community .
in the circumstances and in view of the aforesaid submissions raised by the learned counsel for the Views , this Court must first take into consideration the competence and desirability of this Court in deciding such cases , especially in view of the aforementioned judgment of a Division Bench of this Court .
( III ) That the petitioner submits that the pendency of the matter is an abuse of the process of the court and is also an violation of the provisions of the PC Act , besides being malafide and detrimental to the fundamental rights of the petitioner including the right to life .

if the State Government had revocation of the power of the District Council under Section 35 of the Naghat Act for the settlement of a public servant , it would only exclude the jurisdiction of the District Council and , thereafter , vest in the special possession of the Public Service Magistrate .
14- There is no application on the facts of the present case of Nand Kishore Prasad ( supra ) relied upon by the respondent as it pertained to the issue of examination of the records by the court if he was not satisfied with the language used in the order of dismissal .

Hon'ble Akhilesh Chandra , J. in Medserved Singh ( in 264 ) Trilok Narayan Singh @ Tripurbridge Narayan Singh and Ors . ( in 265 ) Versus State of Bihar ( in both ) Criminal Appeal ( J ) Nos. 264 with 245 of 2002 decided on 24th February , 2014 .

14 . therefore , in view of these very impressive evidences , i.e. , the oral evidence supported by documentary evidences , I find that the market value determined by the Land Acquisition Judge is just and fair and , therefore , the finding of the Land Acquisition Judge is hereby affirmed .
26- It cannot be accepted from the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that a situation arising at a particular time cannot remain the same and it may not be possible to keep pace with a class - wise or a life - wise changing situation after a few years .
thereafter , on 17.09.1997 , the present petition was filed by Smt . Rama Devi declaring that the land in question , from the acquisition proceedings initiated for the Board , was excluded and the action of the Board to make the pulling down of the house , is wholly without jurisdiction .

Mr. Vindhyachal Singh , learned counsel stressed that plea by the advocates in the Patna High Court is not restricted under the impugned Rules because according to the learned counsel Mr. Vindhyachal Singh , the impugned Rules is intended to regulate the aspect of practicing law in the Patna High Court only .
hence , I hold that in the impugned judgment the finding of the Court that the suit is barred by the principle of adverse possession is devoid of jurisdiction and will not act as res judicata as between the parties in any subsequent suit or proceeding in respect of the suit property .
the Statutes and the delegated legislation also have a presumption in favour of constitutionality , and it is only in case of a clear violation beyond reasonable doubt of the constitutional provision ( or the substantive law in the matter of a delegated legislation ) that the court should declare it unconstitutional .
here it appears that this witness , after perusal of the post mortem report or after seeing the dead body of his brother , deceased Rajan Kumar , had given a variable evidence that his brother did not have received firearms injuries and he was assaulted with a well made pistol .

aggrieved by the same , the State of Bihar had filed a revision petition before the Collector - cum - District Settlement Officer , Sukul through Revision Case No. 10 of 2013 ( Anarabad ) , State of Bihar through Amalee , Kishangpur , through Collector vs. Chaglan Sindhi and others ) .
36- On the above aspect of the matter , ( 2006 ) 11 SCC 420 , a report made out in Kailash vs. State of Madhya Pradesh , could be noticed , wherein the Supreme Court has observed as follows : 21 . the place of injury was on parital area .
